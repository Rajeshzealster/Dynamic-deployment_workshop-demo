# FogDEFTKube: An Extended FogDEFT Framework Supporting Kubernetes and Continuous Integration

## Project Overview

FogDEFTKube is an extended framework built upon the OASIS - Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) tailored for fog computing. This framework provides a user-friendly paradigm to model and dynamically deploy fog services remotely and on-demand. FogDEFTKube maintains four essential layers of abstraction:

1. **Platform Independence:** Utilizes Docker Containerization technology for seamless deployment across different platforms.

3. **Interoperability:** Leverages Kubernetes features to establish seamless inter-service communication and orchestration.

4. **Portability:** Incorporates TOSCA, a vendor-neutral modeling language, ensuring flexibility and compatibility with various cloud providers.
